# Code Challenge: Microservice Starter

## Goal
To test your ability to be self sufficient, work with 3rd party data, and write code. You have about 4 hours to complete the challenge and at the end youâ€™ll present your work.

## Challenge
Create a web server (prefferably in Node.js) that pulls data from an external data source and returns it in the following [Data Microservice API](CommonServiceAPI.md) format. This is a trivialized version of an API that is used on a Collinear Group project. This api allows multiple micro-services to supply disparate time series data through a single service and user interface.

The external data source that you will use can be any kind of **Time Series** public data: a downloaded CSV, data you manually scrapped from a website, or a public API. It is up to you to choose the source.

## Evaluation
At the end of the alotted time you will join up with the Collinear Team and walk us through your approach. Be prepared for questions.

## Getting Started

You can refer to the existing `nodejs-example` as an example of a microservice that implements the [API](CommonServiceAPI.md).

Put all your code in a sub directory and include instructions on how to get started with your service.

Ready? Go!
